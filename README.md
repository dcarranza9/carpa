# CARPA

## Documentation ##

The Automatic Palm Oil Fruit Bunch Classifier (CARPA) is a technological solution based on artificial
intelligence aimed at the oil palm sector. CARPA applies evaluation criteria for fresh fruit bunches (RFF)
for hybrid and commercial varieties in the hoppers of the processing plants, allowing a more accurate and
timely assessment of the quality of the bunches.

### How to run the project ###

The project use docker, so just run:

```
docker-compose up
```

> If it's first time, the images will be created. Sometimes the project doesn't run at first time because
> the init of postgres, just run again `docker-compose up` and it will work.

### When there are changes in the database container ###

It may be useful to run:

```
docker-compose down --volumes
```
 
And again run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```


*CARPA app will run in url `localhost:8000`*

To recreate the docker images after dependencies changes run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

To remove the docker containers including database (Useful sometimes when dealing with migrations):

```
docker-compose down
```

### Accessing Administration

The django admin site of the CARPA project can be accessed at `localhost:8000/admin`

By default the development configuration creates a superuser with the following credentials:

```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

## Production Deployment: ##

The project is dokku ready, this are the steps to deploy it in your dokku server:

#### Server Side: ####

> This docs does not cover dokku setup, you should already have configured the initial dokku config including ssh keys

Create app and configure postgres:
```
dokku apps:create carpa
dokku postgres:create carpa
dokku postgres:link carpa carpa
```

> If you don't have dokku postgres installed, run this before:
> `sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git`

Create the required environment variables:
```
dokku config:set carpa ENVIRONMENT=production DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=....
```

Current required environment variables are:

* ENVIRONMENT
* DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
* EMAIL_PASSWORD

Use the same command to configure secret credentials for the app

#### Local Side: ####

Configure the dokku remote:

```
git remote add production dokku@<my-dokku-server.com>:carpa
```

Push your changes and just wait for the magic to happens :D:

```
git push production master
```

Optional: To add SSL to the app check:
https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt

Optional: Additional nginx configuration (like client_max_body_size) should be placed server side in:
```
/home/dokku/<app>/nginx.conf.d/<app>.conf
```

> Further dokku configuration can be found here: http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/
